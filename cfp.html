        Conservation of natural resources, such as wildlife, is of the utmost importance. Recent challenges, such as poaching of animals, loss of habitat, and increasing effects of climate change, have made conservation an increasingly difficult task. Current extinction rates are now 1000 times higher than the natural extinction rate, with future extinction rates 10000 times higher. Fortunately, AI techniques have shown promise in addressing several of these challenges, in the areas of planning and advanced processing of sensor data. One example of AI aiding in conservation planning challenges is game theoretic software assistants that recommend patrol plans to wildlife park rangers for protection of tigers and rhinos (among other animals) from being killed by well-organized poachers. AI techniques have also played a role in processing large amounts of sensor data captured for conservation purposes. Some sensors that are being used in conservation include GPS collars on animals, camera trap photos, and imagery from UAVs. From these data, AI algorithms are automatically identifying objects of interest, for example. In an effort to further bring together the AI and conservation fields, the workshop will welcome papers in a broad area of AI for wildlife conservation.
        Paper topics may include but are not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>adversary modeling</b></li>
        <li><b>patrol planning</b></li>
        <li><b>conservation area planning</b></li>
        <li><b>species modeling</b></li>
        <li><b>aerial monitoring of species</b></li>
        <li><b>drone flight planning</b></li>
        <li><b>wildlife smuggling</b></li>
        <li><b>influencing behaviors to reduce the threat of poaching</b></li>
        <li><b>estimating wildlife population</b></li>
        <li><b>predicting poaching threat</b></li>
        <li><b>computer vision for camera trap imagery</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We expect this workshop to be a recurring workshop, but for this first incarnation, a key facet of this workshop will be a challenge problem. The challenge problem will utilize real world data. We will also make available simulated data from AirSim. Then, we will accept papers for presentation that provide the most innovative or best results on the dataset. This will be due on July 7. Attendance at the workshop is not required for submission for the challenge problem. More information can be found here.
