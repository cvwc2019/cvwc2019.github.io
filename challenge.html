          The challenge will take Amur tiger conservation as an example to explore the usages of CV techniques for endangered wildlife conservation. The Amur tiger (also known as Siberian tiger, Northeast-China tiger) is a tiger population in the Far East region (particularly the Russian Far East and Northeast China). It currently has about 600 wild individuals in the world, so that the conservation of Amur tiger is of crucial importance.
        </p>
        <p><b>Dataset:</b> With the help of WWF and 3rd party vendors, we collected the ATRW (Amur Tiger Re-identification in the Wild) dataset,
        which contains more than 8,000 Amur tiger video clips from 92 individuals collected from ~10 zoos in China, with bounding-box, keypoint based pose and identity annotations for sampled video frames. The dataset will be divided into training, validation, and testing subsets. The training/validation subsets along with annotations will be released to public, with the annotations for the test subset withheld by the organizers.
        </p>
        <p><b>Requirement:</b> Due to the public benefit nature of this workshop, we require each participant team agrees to open source their solution to help wildlife conservation. All participating teams are required to use only our released public available dataset for training, and submit their challenge results as well as full source-code packages for evaluation.

          <b>Tiger Detection</b>: From images/videos captured by cameras, this task aims to place tight bounding boxes to any tiger targets. As the detection is running on edge-side (smart cameras), both the detection accuracy (in terms of AP) and the runtime-cost are used to measure the quality of the detector.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tiger Pose Detection</b>: From images/videos with detected tiger bounding-box, this task aims to estimate tiger pose (i.e., keypoint landmarks) for tiger image alignment/normalization, so that pose variations are removed or alleviated in the tiger re-identification step. We will use mean average precision (mAP) and object keypoint similarity (OKS) to evaluate the performance of teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tiger Re-ID with human alignment(plain Re-ID)</b>: We define a set of queries and a target database of Amur tigers. Both queries and target in the database are already aligned with bounding-box and pose information. Tiger re-identification aims to find all the database images of the same tiger as the query. Both mAP and rank-1 accuracy will be used to evaluate the accuracy of different models.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tiger Re-ID in the wild</b>: This track will evaluate the accuracy of tiger re-identification in wild with fully automatic pipeline. To simulate the real case, none annotation is given out . With all raw images (in test set) given, teams should automaticly detect tigers in those images to form the gallary and query. Both mAP and rank-1 accuracy will be used to evaluate the accuracy of different models.
